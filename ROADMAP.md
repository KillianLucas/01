# Roadmap

Our goal is to power a billion devices with the _01OS over the next 10 years. The Cambrian explosion of AI devices. 

We can do that with your help. Help extend the _01OS to run on new hardware, to connect with new peripherals like GPS and cameras, and add new locally running language models to unlock use-cases for this technology that no-one has even imagined yet. 

In the upcoming weeks, we're going to release: 

- [ ] An open-source language model for computer control
      
- [ ] An app for your phone
      
- [ ] A hand-held device that runs fully offline.

- [ ] Train model optimized for computer control

- [ ] Publish open source protocols and benchmarks

- [ ] Expanding the devices supported by _01OS
